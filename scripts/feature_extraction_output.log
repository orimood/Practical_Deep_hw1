FEATURE EXTRACTION EXPERIMENT COMPLETE
====================================================================================================

Key Findings:
  Best Feature Extraction Model: SVM (RBF)
  Test Accuracy: 1.0000

Parameter Settings:
  Feature Extractor: ResNet-50 (pretrained on ImageNet)
  Feature Dimension: 2048
  Training Set Size: 6300
  Number of Classes: 9

Processing Changes:
  - Removed last FC layer from ResNet-50
  - Extracted 2048-dimensional features
  - Applied classical ML algorithms on fixed features
  - No fine-tuning (features remain fixed from ImageNet pretraining)
